## Project Overview:
- A 2d platformer/side-scroller created in Unity
- Inspired by Studio Ghibli
- A no objective world explorative game
- Includes custom models and animations (by Vince Cappelluti)
- Creators were first time Unity users
- Engineer (Ayo Fatoye) was a first time game dev

## Overview of Concepts Learned: 
1. Rigging/Animating for Unity
- porting assets from Maya to Unity
- setting .fbx files up for game environment/user input
2. The Parallax Effect
- how one could use it to create the illusion of depth
3. Level Design
- can use procedural techniques for large levels
- for this project, used mirroring to create the illusion of a larger project
4. Scripting for GameObjects in Unity
- to control player movement, camera movement
- player abilities (jump, blast, etc)
- world object interactivity (portals to other levels/worlds)
5. Asset gathering/development
- made platforms, players, characters, objects, portals, etc all using Midjourney (as Ayo is no artist)
6. Animator Controller
- used in conjunction with transitions and states
- state: isJumping, isIdle, etc
7. Camera Controller
- previously never even gave thought to the deliberate movement of the camera in games I play
- offset properly to allow camera to follow player without being too close
8. Game/World Physics
- rigidbody: different types: kinematic, dynamic, etc
- colliders: almost everything needs some type of collider
9. rendering layers
- what goes on top of what relative to the cameraâ€™s view
10. lighting
- definitely affects the feel of your game
